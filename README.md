<h2><strong>m4x-Legendary</strong></h2>
<p>This is a very small addon that plays the Hearthstone Legendary card loot sound when you get a legendary item in-game.</p>
<p>Nothing much to say about it ;)</p>
<p>You can use <strong>/legtestsound</strong> to test the sound <strong>- Added in v1.1.1</strong></p>
